// syncGrants performs the server-driven grant authorization sync. It must
// run before any local scanning and under the collector runlock (Run
// guarantees both). The device's own credentials fetch the authoritative
// view; the collector never re-runs connect or bind and never changes the
// device identity, progress, or outbox.
//
// Fail-closed rules (contraction safety):
//   - terminal conditions stop local reading unconditionally, even on first
//     contact: a revoked or deleted device, rejected credentials (401/403),
//     a self view naming a different device, or a structurally invalid
//     self response;
//   - after the grant protocol has been seen, any refresh failure or an
//     old-protocol response (anti-downgrade) stops local reading — the
//     cached overlay authorizes nothing;
//   - a server that never spoke the protocol keeps the legacy behavior,
//     including transport-level failures (documented compatibility: reading
//     continues under local grants and the drain reports the failure);
//   - a revision that keeps advancing during the sync stops the run rather
//     than reading under a stale revision.
//
// The ack is sent only after the view is durably applied and the managed
// grant merge completed; fully applied revisions ack as
// applyState=applied, restricted ones (unknown tool, missing default
// directory, manually disabled grant) ack as applyState=pending so the
// server UI never keeps claiming a full application that no longer holds.
// The ack also carries the collector's capability report — the registered
// supportedTools list and one closed-code pendingReason per restricted
// tool (names and codes only, never local paths). An older server that
// rejects those unknown fields is re-acked once with the legacy payload;
// that fallback is recorded as "capabilities NOT reported" so it is never
// claimed as delivered and is retried on the next run. The same revision
// is re-acked whenever the applied state, collector version, or the
// capability/reason payload changes; an old revision's ack never stands
// in for a newer one. Ack failures are non-fatal and retried on the next
// run.
