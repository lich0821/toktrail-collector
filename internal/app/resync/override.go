// replaceExistingFeature is the server capability that must be advertised
// before any override upload: older servers decode the ingest body with
// DisallowUnknownFields and reject the replaceExisting flag with 400
// invalid_json, so the pass probes GET /v1/capabilities first and fails
// closed (nothing ledgered) when the feature is absent.
const replaceExistingFeature = "replace-existing"

// RunOverride performs one explicitly confirmed override pass: it scans
// the CURRENT codex-jsonl and deepseek-harness sources, and retransmits
// every record whose current-scan content differs from the effective
// baseline (or that no baseline has ever seen) with
// BatchRequest.replaceExisting=true, so the server replaces its same-key
// copy with the current scanned record. Records the current scan no
// longer produces, and every record of other sources, are untouched.
//
// Semantics and guarantees:
//   - The current scan is authoritative: same-key conflicts are resolved
//     in favor of the freshly scanned record, and the acknowledged
//     override content is the baseline a later comparison uses (a scan
//     that reverted to the archived value is a NEW drift, not
//     "already synced"). The server has the final say — a record the
//     server rejects (any code, including record_conflict) is NOT
//     confirmed and its attempt stays pending for the next explicit
//     pass; the client never assumes a replacement happened without a
//     receipt.
//   - Capability gate: the server must advertise the replace-existing
//     feature before anything is ledgered, so an old server can never
//     freeze a source behind pending attempts it cannot resolve.
//   - The authoritative baseline is durable: every uploaded key is first
//     persisted in the override ledger as a pending attempt, and promoted
//     to confirmed only for records the receipt accepted (by exact
//     index). The previous confirmed content is never discarded while a
//     new attempt is in flight.
//   - Frozen attempts: a crash between the server's acknowledgment and
//     the local confirmation leaves the attempt pending with its exact
//     content and its persistent attempt id. The next pass re-uploads
//     that FROZEN payload under its deterministic batch identity FIRST
//     (the server replays it if it was already applied), promotes it on
//     the acknowledgment, and only then starts a new override round for
//     keys whose scan drifted further. A pending attempt is never
//     recomputed from a fresh scan, never auto-discarded when the source
//     changed or deleted the key, and never dropped because a receipt is
//     missing — otherwise the server could hold a replaced record the
//     local state no longer knows.
//   - Attempt identities are per-key, persisted, and folded into the
//     batch id together with the full canonical content: a content
//     sequence A→B→A can never reuse the first A's server receipt, and a
//     retry of the same attempt always replays the same batch.
//   - Pending (unconfirmed) attempts block normal collection of their
//     source fail-closed (see overrides.ApplyToBaseline) and are never
//     applied by plain resync: an unconfirmed override is never treated
//     as authoritative.
//   - Authorization is unchanged: the pass re-checks the live device
//     authorization (preflight with durable attempt accounting), honors
//     pause/revocation, evaluates every record against the live consent
//     scope before it is sent, and requires an enabled local source
//     grant for every scanned input. Out-of-scope records are withheld
//     and reported — they are never uploaded and never ledgered.
//   - Honesty: a pass with invalid current-scan records (structurally
//     not uploadable) or unresolved attempts is NEVER reported as
//     completed; scan line issues and quarantined lines are reported as
//     counted, mirroring normal collection.
//   - Old data is protected: outbox entries, batch files, per-message
//     progress, cursors, and the quarantine store are never modified.
//     The override ledger supersedes stored payloads for baseline
//     comparison only.
//   - The pass is bound to the device and server recorded in the ledger;
//     a collector bound differently fails closed.
