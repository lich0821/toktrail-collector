// It never re-runs connect or bind, never reads or writes collector state
// (grants, cursors, outbox, export journal), never inspects or rewrites
// scheduler registration, and never contacts the upload endpoint. Because
// the binary path is unchanged, an existing scheduler entry that invokes
// this exact path keeps working without re-registration; when the target is
// discovered via PATH, callers must not assume that path is the one the
// scheduler invokes - with multiple installations or symlinks, pass the
// scheduler's actual directory as -install-dir.
//
// There is no automatic rollback: a failed upgrade leaves the previous
// binary in place (verification happens before replacement), and the kept
// .previous copy is an unverified convenience snapshot, not a promise of a
// safe rollback. A verified rollback means stopping scheduled runs and
// reinstalling the previous signed release with install -allow-downgrade.
